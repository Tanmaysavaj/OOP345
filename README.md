## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

his C++ project was developed as part of my Object-Oriented Programming course in Semester 3. It simulates a simplified online store management system, where users can view items, make purchases, and generate invoices.

The program demonstrates core OOP principles such as class inheritance, encapsulation, constructors/destructors, file handling, and object management through a console-based user interface.


ðŸ›  Key Features:
Display list of store items (with names, prices, quantities)

Add customer purchase details

Calculate total cost and generate a basic invoice

Use of constructors/destructors for proper object lifecycle

File I/O to store purchase details
